# Welcome to the self-paced `dlt` Fundamentals Course!

![simpsons-hello.gif](giphy.gif)

In this course you will learn the fundamentals of `dlt` alongside some of the most important topics in the world of Pythonic data engineering.

## **Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll be covering:**

### Lesson 1: [Quick Start](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dlt-hub/dlt/blob/master/docs/education/dlt-fundamentals-course/lesson_1_quick_start.ipynb)

Discover what `dlt` is, run your first pipeline with toy data, and explore it like a pro using DuckDB, `sql_client`, and `dlt` datasets!

### Lesson 2: [dlt Resources and Sources](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dlt-hub/dlt/blob/master/docs/education/dlt-fundamentals-course/lesson_2_dlt_sources_and_resources_create_first_dlt_pipeline.ipynb)

Learn to run pipelines with diverse data sources (dataframes, databases, and REST APIs), 
master `dlt.resource`, `dlt.source`, and `dlt.transformer`, and create your first REST API pipeline!

### Lesson 3: [Pagination & Authentication & `dlt` Configuration](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dlt-hub/dlt/blob/master/docs/education/dlt-fundamentals-course/lesson_3_pagination_and_authentication_and_dlt_configuration.ipynb)

Since it is never a good idea to publicly put your API keys into your code, different environments have different methods to set and access these secret keys. `dlt` is no different.
Master pagination and authentication for REST APIs, explore `dlt`'s `RESTClient` and manage secrets and configs.

### Lesson 4: [Using dltâ€™s pre-built Sources and Destinations](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dlt-hub/dlt/blob/master/docs/education/dlt-fundamentals-course/lesson_4_using_pre_build_sources_and_destinations.ipynb)
Now that you took a data source and loaded it into a `duckdb` destination, it is time to look into what other possibilities `dlt` offers.
In this notebook we will take a look at pre-built verified sources and destinations and how to use them.

### Lesson 5: [Write disposition and incremental loading](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dlt-hub/dlt/blob/master/docs/education/dlt-fundamentals-course/lesson_5_write_disposition_and_incremental_loading.ipynb)

Learn to control data behavior with dlt write dispositions (Append, Replace, Merge), master incremental loading, and efficiently update and deduplicate your datasets.

### Lesson 6: [How dlt works](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dlt-hub/dlt/blob/master/docs/education/dlt-fundamentals-course/lesson_6_how_dlt_works.ipynb)

Discover the magic behind `dlt`! Learn its three main steps â€” Extract, Normalize, Load â€” along with default behaviors and supported file formats.

### Lesson 7: [Inspecting & Adjusting Schema](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dlt-hub/dlt/blob/master/docs/education/dlt-fundamentals-course/lesson_7_inspecting_and_adjusting_schema.ipynb)

`dlt` creates and manages the schema automatically, but what if you want to control it yourself? Explore the schema and customize it to your needs easily with `dlt`!

### Lesson 8: [Understanding Pipeline State & Metadata](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dlt-hub/dlt/blob/master/docs/education/dlt-fundamentals-course/lesson_8_understanding_pipeline_metadata_and_state.ipynb)

After learning about pipelines and how to move data from one place to another, we now turn to information about the pipeline itself â€” the metadata that can be accessed and edited through `dlt`.
This notebook explores `dlt` states, what they collect, and where this extra information is stored. It also expands on what the load info and trace in `dlt` can do.

## Thatâ€™s it! ðŸŽ‰

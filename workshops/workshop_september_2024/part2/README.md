In this part of the course, you will get hands-on experience with dlt and the world of Pythonic data engineering as you deepen your understanding of topics previously touched upon.

## **Hereâ€™s what weâ€™ll be covering:**

All these topics are covered in a single Colab notebook this time, [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1u3sOsQpUJ1cCNbKs4ExobPxklk5wEeaF?usp=sharing). You can either make a copy of the notebook, or open it in Playground mode to do all the exercises!
